        Our products are crafted exclusively from the dreams and screams of
         young kids who wanted to show their mastery in their chosen fields, 
         but were directed towards a factory for daily wages. 
         Each cracker bursts brighter than their lost smiles, 
         and can be heard louder than their cries for miles.
         Buy them, burst them, brag about them. <span>The choice is yours. Because they donâ€™t have one.</span>
